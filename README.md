# Swift-DataManager-Template

What is this?
---------------------

DataManager is a Xcode Template who make work with UICollectionView and UITableView very simple. You can just create this file, install required types and connect in main class! 

Why you will use this?
---------------------

Many people use DataSource and Delegate in main ViewController, but is the bad taste. If you are using MVC architecture, then your ViewController will increase and little kittens will cry. Apple engineers don't like when little kittens cry and recommended use a separate class for work with Delegate/DataSource. So, I don't say that this template is needed, but he very simplifies my work and I hope, you can feel it.

How do I install it?
---------------------

1. Open Xcode Template Folder by path `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates` (this is a hidden folder, but you can use the Finder's `Go > Go to Folder...` menu to open it).
2. Drag and drop `DataManager.xctemplate` into this folder.
3. Open Xcode and just create new file!
